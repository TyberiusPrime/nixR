* symlinking -> replace with smart 'look for last revision' functionality
(don't make the symlinks..)
* replace nixpkgs flake imports with tarballs

* bioconductor, don't reparse when 'finished' and parsed.bincode.gz available
* turn 'removed from cran' into a potentially temporary condition, instead of 
  the 'final event' it is right now in the model
